# Wednesday, May 8, 2024 Modernize Biology Codes Bi-Weekly Meeting

## Admin

- [Previous Meeting's Notes](https://github.com/ajpowelsnl/bio-proxy-apps/blob/main/meeting_notes/2024/2024-05-01.md)
- Continue onboarding Gavin and Logan on Sandia systems
- **TODO:**
  - Amy ask Phyllis for help w/ accounts re-authorization
    - Good to go? 
  - Logan:  find out if you can purchase / obtain "business" laptop
  - Team:  Consider if we want to run project like a true software project, with project board, issues, pull requests, similar to the Kokkos project?


## Scientific Community News / Meetings

- We are core / founding memebers of the "AMD Genomics Focus Group" (stay tuned)
- [Kokkos-Remote-Spaces](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-remote-spaces) V2 release is nigh ..
- **TODO:**
  - Plan to attend and contribute to [SC24](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/)

## Science / Engineering


- [DHT repo](https://github.com/ajpowelsnl/DHT) 
- [de Bruijn Graph Tutorial in "algorithms_tutorial"](https://github.com/ajpowelsnl/bio-proxy-apps/tree/main)




- **TODO:**
  - Team:  figure out how to merge changes in, and how we want to manage the main repo?  Can we follow Kokkos' example for code and project management?
  - Team:  think about SC24 Abstract and poster
  - Team:  Using DHT repo as a learning aid, continue focusing on exactly what’s happening in the initial events of kmer analysis for a single read set (i.e., not “paired end” reads), towards the goal of understanding (see output below):
    - How kmers (from a 100 base read, for instance) are made
    - How and where kmers are stored (local-to-a-node hash table?)
    - How is UPC++ distributed object formed from local hash tables (assuming that is what occurs …?)
    - Understand the purpose of the “extension” step
